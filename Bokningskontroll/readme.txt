MailCat is Freeware!

Email me feature requests and I might add it in
if people actually use this program. 

MailCat is a simple POP3 email checker. It does
a little animation in the tray when you get email.

It is easy to set up, and use. A single click checks your
email. If you got email, and the animation is going,
a single click will start your default email client. A double
click brings up the settings box. A right click has
a couple of options, like to quit and stuff.

To compile:
Run the batch file to create icons.res - NOTE: If you have Delphi 5
installed in a directory other than the default, you will
have to modify "Run to create the res.bat" with a text editor.
Open MailCat.dpr in Delphi 5, and compile. That is it!

Released: August 18, 1999
Source code is pure object pascal, straight win API and is available 
by request. It was written in Borland Delphi 5.0.
